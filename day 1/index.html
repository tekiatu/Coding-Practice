    <h1>Gleydson Cardoso AKA Tekiatu</h1>
    <h2>From accounting to IT</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in the capital of Brazil. Coming from a humble family, I learned some of the core values that I carry with me in life: respect and cooperation. As a young adult, I completed high school and was awarded a full scholarship to study accounting at a private college near Brasília. I studied and worked in the field until I decided to change careers. To do so, I started with the foundation—learning English through an exchange program—before pursuing my first diploma in Web Development in Australia.

        Today, I practice and hope to land my first job in the field.</p>
